A place to store my bioinformatics scripts
------------------------------------------
This repository is for keeping a bunch of my scripts tracked and accessible from multiple locations. 
As it stands now, there isn't a cohesive theme or consistent style to them, but they reflect various bioinformatic tasks I have tried to do.
Some scripts are inspired by others and many have solutions obtained by checking online discussions such as stackExchange and biostars.
Please let me know if you spot clear problems or better ways to implement what I'm doing, and feel free to use them and adapt them to your tasks.
